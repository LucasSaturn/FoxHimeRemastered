--USAGE--

To use spriteHover.lua, you must do the following:

	-	declare an image data variable, using `love.image.newImageData()`
	-	declare the scale of the sprite onscreen
	-	declare the x and y co-ordinates of the sprite onscreen


Since this script is extremely basic, you are not able to use rotation on your sprites. 

Function: testMouseOver()
Parameters:
	-	spriteX, X position of the sprite on screen
	-	spriteY, Y position of the sprite on screen
	-	spriteImageData, contains the pixel data, declared by `love.image.newImageData()
	-	scaleX, X scale of the sprite on screen
	-	scaleY, Y scale of the sprite on screen
	-	requireAlpha, whether or not you want to test for an alpha channel
