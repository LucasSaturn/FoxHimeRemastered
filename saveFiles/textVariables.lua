"It seems that she hasn't hidden her tail again. Fortunately, it was only me \nin the bedroom; it would be terrible for others see this.",
"After seeing it, I had a mischievous thought while getting dressed...",
"So, I reached out to touch that flapping tail.",

"However, as soon as I touched the tail, it suddenly withdrew back into the\ncurtain.",
"┌What do you think you are doing?┘",
"Then came a scolding from the owner of the tail.",
"┌You're awake? Then get up quickly, and get ready.┘",
"How could she be so careless, she was awake after all... Wasn't she afraid of\nfrightening others?",

"┌Is there anyone else who can yell like you do?┘",
"The tail's owner drew the curtain aside and leaned out. Her face was so close \nto mine, it was as if we were going to kiss.",
"┌I just saw a tail that was flapping, so I accidently...┘",
"The tail belongs to Mori, a fox spirit that lives with me.",
"┌Never do this again!┘",

"┌Okay, okay, I promise I won't, but you need to hurry.┘",
"My first class this morning was Linear Algebra. The teacher is very strict, and \nhe would be sure to check attendance in every class, so I don't want to be late.",
"┌What time is it now?┘",
"┌Almost half past eight.┘",
"┌Really?┘",

"Mori looked around and glanced at the alarm clock....",
"┌What? It's half past eight already?! Why didn't you wake me up earlier, \nseeming as you have time to touch my tail? Turn away!┘",
"┌Ok, fine, Lord Mori.┘",
"Damn it, how can she be mad at me, while she herself turned off the \nalarm...?",
"As Mori drew the curtain closed, I turned away..."}
